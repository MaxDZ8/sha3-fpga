`timescale 1ns / 1ps
// Tick a led. Not quite PWM. For example, PWM 50% is something like:
// ------------PERIOD--------------
// ------DUTY------
// ||||||||||||||||________________||||||||||||||||________________
// Whereas our 50% is:
// |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_
// PWM works high frequency but then due to the long pulses it effectively reduces the blink frequency.
// By contrast, I try to leave the "on" time fixed at the fastest possible.
// Give me ~100MHZ clock. Will be reduced to some appropriate 'blink' frequency.
// Control brightness level using the .level port
// 00 - OFF
// 01 - WEAK (aka FAINT), probably unsuitable for most purposes but visible in the dark.
// 10 - ON. Suggested setting for normal operation.
// 11 - FULLBRIGHT  some boards are uncomfortable at this brightness level but it is appropriate for blink,
//      emphasis, get more attention.
// Leds can flip in the Mhz with ease, but the driving transistors might distort a lot.
// Contemporary (Dec 2020) LED dimmers go 100khz - 1Mhz.
